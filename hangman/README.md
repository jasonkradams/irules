# Hangman

This was sourced from the DevCentral Article: [Hangman game (Optimized for v11.x)](https://community.f5.com/kb/codeshare/hangman-game-optimized-for-v11-x/284299). Unfortunately, that version has become mangled over time with our various DevCentral platform migrations.

This code should live on, so here we go.

## Setup

1. Create the iRule:
    > **Web UI** -> **Local Traffic** -> **iRules** -> **iRule List**
2. Create the External Data Group as a Text File on your desktop.
3. Import the External Data Group to the LTM
    > **Web UI** -> **System** -> **File Management** -> **Data Group File List** -> **Import**
    * **Name** is arbitrary.
    * File Contents = **String**
    * Data Group Name = **Hangmanwords**
4. Play!

## Word Lists for Hangman

You're welcome to use [Hangmanwords.datagroup.txt](./Hangmanwords.datagroup.txt), which was generated with this command:

```

Here are some other sources for word lists you can use in your Hangman game. These range from basic dictionaries to themed or difficulty-based lists.

### ðŸ“š General Word Lists

  ```

  You can filter it for game-friendly word lengths:

  ```bash
  grep -E '^[a-z]{4,8}$' /usr/share/dict/words | sort -u
